- Developed predictive models using Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, and SVM to forecast customer subscription behavior with up to 91% accuracy.
- Cleaned and processed large datasets (4,0000+ records), including handling missing values, factorizing categorical data, and performing feature selection using Lasso Regression.
- Fine-tuned machine learning models through cross-validation, reducing error rates and increasing accuracy for complex, imbalanced datasets.
- Applied advanced R techniques, including data manipulation, visualization, and statistical modeling, with libraries such as `caret`, `ggplot2`, `glmnet`, and `e1071`.

- Identified trends in TED Talks from 2006 to 2017, including a steady rise in talks until 2013 and a shift towards quality content thereafter.
- Revealed that TED Talks with high views do not necessarily lead to high audience engagement.
- Performed sentiment analysis showing a predominance of positive language in TED Talks, reinforcing TED's inspirational branding.
- Mapped speaker occupation types, identifying writers and activists as dominant groups in TED Talks.
- **Text Analysis:** Conducted sentiment and word frequency analysis to uncover thematic content.
- Applied Regression Techniques to explore relationship between views and comments.
