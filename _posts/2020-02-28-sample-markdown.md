<h2 id="airbnb-analysis">Analyses of High Bookings on Airbnb panel dataset</h2>

- **Role:** Critical member in analyzing Airbnb's high bookings in Los Angeles.
- **Methods Used:** Ensemble methods, causality analysis, data cleaning, feature engineering.
- **Results:** Found pricing strategies and property types that yield high returns.
- **Tools:** Gradient Boosted Decision Trees, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).

<h2 id="bank-customer-prediction">Bank Customer Subscription Prediction</h2>

- Developed predictive models using Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, and SVM to forecast customer subscription behavior with up to 91% accuracy.
- Cleaned and processed large datasets (4,0000+ records), including handling missing values, factorizing categorical data, and performing feature selection using Lasso Regression.
- Fine-tuned machine learning models through cross-validation, reducing error rates and increasing accuracy for complex, imbalanced datasets.
- Applied advanced R techniques, including data manipulation, visualization, and statistical modeling, with libraries such as `caret`, `ggplot2`, `glmnet`, and `e1071`.
